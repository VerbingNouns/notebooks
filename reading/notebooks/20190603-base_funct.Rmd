# Introduction {.tabset}

This workshop is designed to introduce you to practical uses and issues in R and RStudio, aimed at linguists and psychologists (well, psycholinguists). In this first day, we will start with the fundamentals of interacting with the programs.

## R and RStudio interfaces

R is a programming language that we can use to tell the computer what to do. We can "speak" R to the computer a number of ways, e.g., through the command line (Terminal in Macs) or through the R app.

## Base R functionality 

### R is a calculator

Its least unique function is to compute arithmetic. You probably don't want to use R just to add sums, but you could do.
```{r}
3 + 4
```

White space doesn't matter for most things (so you can put spaces between numbers, operations, names).
```{r}
3+4
```

Order of operations follows standard rules (BIDMAS / BODMAS / PEMDAS):
```{r}
3*4^2
```
```{r}
(3*4)^2
```


### R is for interacting with data files

> Dataset `sleep`:

```{r}
head(sleep)
```

* column 1 = how many extra hours of sleep were recorded
* column 2 = which drug was administered
* column 3 = which participant

## Indicies

### Finding the index of the value you want

What does this do?
```{r}
sleep[1,]
```

How does this differ from `[1,]`?
```{r}
sleep[2,] # so that means this is row 2
```

How does this differ from `[3,]`?
```{r}
sleep[,3] # what do you think this is?
```

â€¦which makes it `dataset[row,column]`

## More descriptive methods

You can also navigate with column names:
```{r}
sleep$ID
```

How would you view the column `extra`?
```{r}
sleep$extra
```

Use `str()` to get a summary of the structure of the dataset
```{r}
str(sleep)
```

What are all the unique values in `ID`?
```{r}
unique(sleep$extra)
```

What's the value in the first row, third column?
```{r}
sleep[1,3]
```

What's the first element in the column `ID`?
```{r}
sleep[1,]$ID
sleep$ID[1]
```

You can also view the dataset as a spreadsheet (although it can't be altered).
```{r}
View(sleep)
```
