Download course materials (.zip file) from [here](http://bit.ly/RforLinguists-201906) *after 2nd June*.

[**bit.ly/RforLinguists-201906**](http://bit.ly/RforLinguists-201906)

You will need these datasets today:

1. [binomial-data.csv](../data/binomial-data.csv)
2. [simulated-data.csv](../data/simulated-data.csv)

You may also need to install the packages `ggbeeswarm` and `yarrr` (which comes with a [lovely tutorial](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/)):
```{r}
install.packages("ggbeeswarm")
install.packages("yarrr")
```

Load in today's libraries.
```{r}
# https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/pirateplot.html
library(tidyverse)
library(ggbeeswarm)
library(yarrr)
```

# Why dataviz?

If you don't know the shape of your data, you might not draw appropriate conclusions about the statistical tests you perform.

Check out the [Datasaurus Dozen](https://www.autodeskresearch.com/publications/samestats), which all have the same x/y means and standard deviations:

Dataviz is also engaging, communicative, creative, efficient, and fun.

# Plotting in base R

I think it's good to know how to do it, but for most purposes, `ggplot2` will be easier and more powerful.

## Scatter plots

Plot the geocoordinates of `quakes`:
```{r}
# plot( y ~ x )
# plot( x, y )
```

Change the colour and point character (pch):
```{r}

```

Change colour by longitude with a split at 175˚S:
```{r}
plot(••• ~ •••, 
     col=•••, 
     pch=•••, 
     xlim=c(160,190), 
     ylim=c(-40,-10))
points(••• ~ •••, 
       col=•••, 
       pch=•••)
```

Change axis labels and add a vertical line to show the split:
```{r}
•••
abline(v=•••,col=•••,lty="dashed")
```

## Box plots

Here we can visualise the distribution of `sleep` results for groups 1 and 2. We can use the same extra parameters as before to clean it up, too.
```{r}
boxplot(••• ~ •••, 
        col=c("red","blue"),
        xlab="group",
        ylab="extra hours of sleep",
        main="`sleep` dataset")
```

We can add the parameter `notch` to indicate where the bulk of the data are located, and are intended to give a visual estimate if the distributions overlap little enough to estimate that they are distinct populations.
```{r}

```

But how many data points go into these graphs? Not enough to prevent "hinges" from being larger than the actual interquartile ranges. And where *are* the points?

```{r}

```

So we get a decent view of how these groups are distributed, but we can do better.

## When to use base R graphics

The only times I personally use base R to plot things now is when I only want to take a very quick peek at a scatter plot or if I want to use one of the built-in visualisations of regressions (e.g., `qqplot`, which you should now be able to explore on your own!)

# Components of a ggplot

We build up plots in `ggplot2` starting with a base and slowly adding different geometries and properties, using a similar logic to how we added the annotation line to a scatterplot in base R. However, `ggplot` gives us a much more powerful interface because it allows us to do calculations during plotting and remember certain parameters *between* different layers of the plot.

## Base plot

The base plot by itself doesn't look like much, but it already shows us that there's a lot going on.
```{r}

```

Plus it just looks sleeker. (And don't underestimate the power of pleasant-looking graphics!)

One of the parameters of the base plot is `aes()`, which stands for "aesthetics". Aesthetics of the base plot are the attributes of the plot that should be inherited for all layers. This typically includes things like the x-axis, y-axis, any colour-coding by groups, etc. We'll come back to this in a few minutes.

## Geometries

In order to actually see our data, we have to tell R what kind of plot we want to make. Let's start with a scatterplot, i.e., points.
```{r}

```

Notice how we didn't have to specify anything within the parameters for `geom_point()`. This is because everything that it requires has been inherited from the base plot. We could also use different geometries.

`geom_hex` can clearly demonstrate how ggplot does "calculations" during plotting:
```{r}

```

We can try a few others out, but these plots aren't really designed to be informative for these kinds of data.
```{r}

```

Some plots don't need y aesthetics because they calculate y based on frequency in the input:
```{r}

```

And some plots need (at least) one axis to not be continuous data, like `boxplot`.
```{r}

```

### Refresher

How would you use piping to plot only one island's worth of data?
```{r}

```

## Aesthetics

Now let's look at how we can use `aes()` to make our visualisations more informative and engaging.

`sleep` has two groups, so let's plot a boxplot of `extra` with the two groups separated by colour.
```{r}

```

We could also use colour to differentiate between individuals in an interaction plot. Try it with and without colour.
```{r}

```

We can see that actually having colour specified as a distinct aesthetic separates out each of the IDs into pairs of `extra` values rather than treating them as points that all must be connected to each other. Moreover, we don't *need* to specify what colours to use (although we could).

## Axes

We can add layers to change the axes of the plot, add and change the spacing of the ticks, and label things.
```{r}

```

What else would you like to do with this graph?
```{r}
# ?
```

## Themes

What if you don't like having a grey background or you're going to use the plot on a slide with a black background and you want it to look slick?

Try out different themes! (If we put `+ NULL` at the end, we can comment out any line of the graph without having to worry what comes next)
```{r}
quakes %>% 
  ••• +
  #theme_bw() +
  #theme_classic() +
  #theme_dark() +
  #theme_light() +
  #theme_minimal() +
  #theme_test() +
  #theme_void() +
  #theme() +
  NULL
```

## Error bars 

If we generate summaries of our data, we can calculate standard errors and plot error bars.

Let's put error bars on `quakes` after calculating the means and standard errors. Then let's try to make the ribbon defined by the standard deviation.
```{r}

```

## Bar plots

For bar plots, I recommend using summarised data. R can calculate certain things on its own (and there are ways to do any calculation you need using `ggplot2`), but for now this is my recommendation.

Plot means and standard errors of stations reporting for the range of magnitudes, and fill the bars with a continuous colour scale to indicate the number of observations per bar.
```{r}

```

# Beyond the `tidyverse`

There are lots of really fantastic packages for plotting that aren't part of tidyverse or are add-ons that are part of the default offerings of `ggplot2`.

## Beeswarm vs Violin

Beeswarm plots are good for categorical data when you want to see the actual values of the points in each category.

```{r}

```

## Pirate plots

Pirate plots do this sort of graph natively.
```{r}
install.packages("yarrr")
library(yarrr)
```

We can use code copied from the tutorial.
```{r}
pirateplot(formula = stations ~ mag, # dv is stations, iv is magnitude
           data = quakes,
           main = "Pirateplot of stations reporting earthquakes",
           xlab = "magnitude",
           ylab = "stations",
           theme = 1)
```

## Raincloud plots

Originally from [here](https://micahallen.org/2018/03/15/introducing-raincloud-plots/).
```{r}
source("https://gist.githubusercontent.com/benmarwick/2a1bb0133ff568cbe28d/raw/fb53bd97121f7f9ce947837ef1a4c65a73bffb3f/geom_flat_violin.R")
raincloud_theme <- theme(
  text = element_text(size = 10),
  axis.title.x = element_text(size = 16),
  axis.title.y = element_text(size = 16),
  axis.text = element_text(size = 14),
  axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5),
  legend.title = element_text(size = 16),
  legend.text = element_text(size = 16),
  legend.position = "right",
  plot.title = element_text(lineheight = .8, face = "bold", size = 16),
  panel.border = element_blank(),
  panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
  panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
  axis.line.x = element_line(colour = "black", size = 0.5, linetype = "solid"),
  axis.line.y = element_line(colour = "black", size = 0.5, linetype = "solid"))
```

Adapted from [Tidy Raincloud Plot](https://orchid00.github.io/tidy_raincloudplot) tutorial:

# Exploration

> Dataset `simulated-data.csv`

## Structure of the dataset

Using `str`, examine the dataset.
```{r}

```

Check out the first few rows using `head`.
```{r}

```

## Plot the data

Plot boxplots and violin plots for the ratings. Subset by participant.
```{r}

```

Group by region, word, frequency, and grammaticality. Summarise mean and standard error.
```{r}

```


## Bonus: Sandbox

> Dataset `iris`

The function `ggplot` layers different geometries and aesthetics to build up a plot:
```{r}
iris %>%
  mutate(Sepal.Width = Sepal.Width+rnorm(length(Sepal.Width),0,.1))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Species,y=Sepal.Width,fill=Species)) +
  geom_violin(lty=0,alpha=.5)+
  geom_boxplot(alpha=0.5,lwd=.5) +
  geom_quasirandom(dodge.width=1, alpha=.5)
```

In what ways might we change this plot?
```{r}

```

### Inheritance

We can layer two different plots in the same graph by keeping some of the aesthetics undefined in the base plot.

Going back to `quakes`, let's pipe a summary table into ggplot that provides means, standard deviations, and standard errors for both depth and stations reporting, grouped by magnitude. In the graph, plot the means as a path (and points), the standard error as a more opaque ribbon and standard deviation as a more transparent ribbon:
```{r}
quakes %>%
  group_by(•••) %>%
  summarise(n=•••,
            sta=•••,
            staSD=•••,
            staSE=•••,
            dep=•••,
            depSD=•••,
            depSE=•••) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=•••)) +
  geom_point(aes(y=•••),colour="red")+
  geom_path(aes(y=•••),colour="red")+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=•••-•••,ymax=•••+•••),fill="red",alpha=•••) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=•••-•••,ymax=•••+•••),fill="red",alpha=•••) +
  geom_point(aes(y=•••),colour="blue")+
  geom_path(aes(y=•••),colour="blue")+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=•••-•••,ymax=•••+•••),fill="blue",alpha=•••) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=•••-•••,ymax=•••+•••),fill="blue",alpha=•••) +
  theme_bw() + ylab("depth OR number of stations reporting")
```

### Your pick

What kind of graphs do you use most in your research? Can we simulate data as a group and learn to plot it in a few different ways?
