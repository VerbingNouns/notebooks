# Purpose {.tabset .tabset-pills}

While [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) are extremely powerful, flexible tools, they are only useful if you know how to get started. **RfficeHours** is a series of short seminars I will be offering in September 2018 to help staff at and nearby Newcastle University learn the basic functionality of R and how to explore further on their own.

## Design

We all have busy and variable schedules, particular at the begining of term time. Since we will never find one time that suits everyone, I will offer each seminar **three times**. Each week will feature three identical seminars. You are invited to attend as many as you'd like or as many as you can fit in. If you come to one and feel that you would benefit from hearing the lesson again (or running through it again with your own data, etc), I invite you to attend twice or more per week!

This will not be the last time I organise RfficeHours, so if you can't attend any of the seminars this time, you are not out of luck. Hopefully, RfficeHours will become an extension of the [Adventures In R](https://verbingnouns.github.io/AdventuresInR/) workshop(s).
